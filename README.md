# üï∏Ô∏è Web Scraping with Python: AI News, Amazon Prices & Weather Insights

This project demonstrates how to collect real-world data from the web using Python. It covers scraping **AI-related news articles**, **product prices from Amazon**, and **weather reports** from two reliable sources. A bonus task showcases how to automate CAPTCHA clicking using **Selenium**.

Developed to showcase a variety of web scraping techniques, it uses `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `Selenium`, and stores the data in `.csv` and `.txt` formats for further analysis or automation workflows.
